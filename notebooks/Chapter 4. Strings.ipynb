    "### Bit, Bytes to Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers store data in bits, using the two bits `0` and `1`. A sequence of 8 bits is a byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no direct representation of text in computer hardware. This necessitate a translation from bits and bytes to characters / text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The translation is provided by a mapping from bytes to text, and is called a code page. When storing text in memory or on disk, text is converted into bytes using the mapping provided by the code page. A similar translation is employed when coverting bytes to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages have different alphabets, the people of Bougainville have the smallest alphabet in the world; their rotokas alphabet is composed of 12 letters; A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U and V.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise we can come up with a codepage for the Rotokas alphabet using 4 bits to represent each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The english language typically uses the ASCII codepage for encoding and decoding character. ASCII uses 7 bits to represent character. This allows for 127 ($2^7-1$) character to be encoded and decoded. English is a simple language and the entire alphabet can be represented in numbers in the range from 0 to 127 (*65* is capital `A`, *97* is lowercase `a`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Western european language like German have more than 127 character, and extend the range to 255 ($2^8-1$) utilizing 8 bits. The most common encoding for these language is cp-1252 also called \"windows-1252\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are multibyte character sets like Chinese, Korean and Japanese, due to the large alphabet in these languages. But different multi-byte encoding have the same problem as different single byte encoding, the same number means different things that can only be deciphered using the code page.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interoperability is not necessary, application program and operating system can implement a custom code page (encoding and decoding) for text. When using a proprietary binary format, and application can optimize the encoding and decoding of text as no other program is expected to be able to decipher the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "However with the internetworked world, documents and text are shared between users in different geographical locations. In addition to having to utilize the correct code page, computers must agree on a byte-order (big-ending or little-endian) before encoding or decoding characters into binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unicode\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode is a system designed to represent every character from every language. Unicode represent each letter, character or ideograph as a 4-byte number. Each number represents a unique character used in at least one of the world's languages. Not all numbers are used, but more than 64k of them are, so 2 bytes won't suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Character that are used in multiple languages generally have the same number, unless there is good etymological reason not to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback for the using unicode encoding, is the wasteful utilization of disk or memory when representing every character as 4 bytes irrespective of whether it is needed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a unicode encoding utf-32, because 32 bits equals 4 bytes. utf-32 is a straight forward encoding, it takes each unicode character and represents the character with a number. The most important advantage of fixed-width (4 byte) encoding is that you can fine the `Nth` character of a string in constant time\n",
    "\n",
    "utf-16 is a 2 byte encoding of unicode character because most people don't need/use more than 64k characters. It supports additional mechanisms/hacks for characters outside the 64k range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because utf-32 and utf-16 are multibyte encodings, programs and operating systems have to deal with endianness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In utf-16, due to variable byte encoding it is not possible to find the `Nth` character in a string in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UTF-8** is the solution that people came up with that trades off memory requirements, it is a variable length encoding systems for unicode. utf-8 uses just one byte per character for ascii, _extended latin_ character like √∂ utilize two bytes. Chinese characters take up to three bytes. The rarely used characters take four bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages: because each character can take a different number of bytes, finding the Nth character is an O(N) operation ‚Äî that is, the longer the string, the longer it takes to find a specific character. Also, there is bit-twiddling involved to encode characters into bytes and decode bytes into characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: Lower memory footprint. Due to the exact nature of bit twiddling there is no byte-ordering issues. A document encoded in utf-8 uses the same exact stream of bytes on any computer."

    "The most well-known and popular Unicode encoding is UTF-8, but Python doesn't use it internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a string is stored in the UTF-8 encoding, each character is encoded using 1-4 bytes depending on the character it is representing. It's a storage efficient encoding, but it has one significant disadvantage. Since each character can vary in length of bytes, there is no way to randomly access an individual character by index without scanning the string. So, to perform a simple operation such as `string[5]` with UTF-8 Python would need to scan a string until it finds a required character. Fixed length encodings don't have such problem, to locate a character by index Python just multiplies an index number by the length of one character (1, 2 or 4 bytes)."
